# Evolutionary-Optimisation-Algs

Coursework for a course of Genetic and optimalisation algorithms (grade: 92%).

1. First assignment is concerned with the travelling salesman problem, solving with simulated annealing algorithm, a genetic algorithm employing a cycle and NWOX crossover methods and a memetic algorithm.

2. Second assignment solves problems of multi-constrained optimisation, implementing among other things the NSGA-II algorithm, MOGA algorithm and a multi-criterial genetic algorithm along with two local search methods.
